       "[\" 1: SITUATIONAL DILEMMAS\\nQ1. You’re placed in charge of a failing community project. What do you do first?\\n- [Architect] Assess the current system’s weaknesses and begin fixing it.\\n- [Herald] Share the truth of the situation as widely as possible to prompt urgency.\\n- [Keeper] Reaffirm the original mission and remind people why this mattered.\\n- [Shield] Protect the group from blame and outside pressure.\\n- [Synthesizer] Mediate the different voices to understand what’s really going wrong.\\n- [Trickster] Introduce a jarring shift to break stagnation and expose blind spots.\\n- [Weaver] Rebuild trust and connection before addressing logistics.\\n- [Seeker] Suggest stepping away entirely to find a better path elsewhere.\\n- [Spark] Deliver a passionate call to action to reignite purpose.\\n- [Hollow] Observe quietly and avoid getting entangled unless absolutely necessary.\\n\\nQ2. You’re given a powerful tool with no instructions. What do you do?\\n- [Architect] Deconstruct it to reverse-engineer its function.\\n- [Herald] Announce its discovery and speculate publicly about its use.\\n- [Keeper] Compare it to traditional models or historical examples.\\n- [Shield] Safeguard it — its misuse might be dangerous.\\n- [Synthesizer] Cross-reference it with other tools or ideas you've seen.\\n- [Trickster] Try something unexpected to see how it reacts.\\n- [Weaver] Ask others how it makes them feel and what they imagine it could do.\\n- [Seeker] Use it impulsively — the only way to learn is to act.\\n- [Spark] Use it to provoke excitement and momentum.\\n- [Hollow] Set it aside — not everything needs to be used.\\n\\nQ3. A person close to you has started to change in ways you don’t understand. How do you react?\\n- [Architect] Try to analyze the changes rationally and quietly.\\n- [Herald] Speak to them openly — they need to hear how this affects others.\\n- [Keeper] Reference the values or history you’ve shared to reconnect.\\n- [Shield] Stay close and offer protection, even without understanding.\\n- [Synthesizer] Try to see their changes as part of a bigger pattern.\\n- [Trickster] Challenge their assumptions to spark honest discussion.\\n- [Weaver] Show up emotionally and support them where they are.\\n- [Seeker] Respect their transformation and let them evolve freely.\\n- [Spark] Respond with passion — connection is meant to be intense.\\n- [Hollow] Withdraw. People change. You don’t need to follow.\\n\\nQ4. You’re invited into a high-stakes collaboration with unclear power dynamics. How do you approach it?\\n- [Architect] Define clear roles and responsibilities early on.\\n- [Herald] Ask direct questions to clarify what others may avoid saying.\\n- [Keeper] Honor legacy structures and let them guide your behavior.\\n- [Shield] Stay alert for signs of harm or unfair treatment and step in if needed.\\n- [Synthesizer] Study the people involved and find the common thread.\\n- [Trickster] Challenge assumptions subtly to test people’s honesty.\\n- [Weaver] Build trust through one-on-one connections before committing.\\n- [Seeker] Use it as a chance to explore, not control.\\n- [Spark] Assert yourself boldly — your energy is your leverage.\\n- [Hollow] Remain on the fringe, involved but not invested.\\n\\nQ5. A group you're in is spiraling into chaos. What's your natural response?\\n- [Architect] Quietly restructure everything — clarity will stabilize it.\\n- [Herald] Speak openly to cut through confusion.\\n- [Keeper] Remind the group of its purpose and original agreements.\\n- [Shield] Focus on grounding and protecting individuals who are overwhelmed.\\n- [Synthesizer] Map the chaos — there's a pattern inside it.\\n- [Trickster] Amplify the chaos briefly to show what’s broken.\\n- [Weaver] Soothe tensions and rebuild emotional safety.\\n- [Seeker] Let the group fall — maybe it’s not meant to survive.\\n- [Spark] Take charge through sheer presence and intensity.\\n- [Hollow] Detach. Chaos isn’t your responsibility.\\n\\nQ6. You discover a truth that could destabilize something important. What do you do?\\n- [Architect] Weigh the consequences before acting.\\n- [Herald] Share it — people deserve to know, even if it shakes things.\\n- [Keeper] Preserve the system; not all truths need telling.\\n- [Shield] Reveal it only if someone’s safety depends on it.\\n- [Synthesizer] Frame the truth carefully to integrate it without collapse.\\n- [Trickster] Leak it in a way that forces others to confront it.\\n- [Weaver] Tell those affected directly and support them through it.\\n- [Seeker] Take the truth and walk — you don’t owe anyone a fight.\\n- [Spark] Turn it into a rallying cry for change.\\n- [Hollow] Keep it to yourself. Let the truth be your own silence.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \" 2: IDENTITY REFLECTION\\nQ1. In a group, you tend to:\\n- [Architect] Build systems or processes to help things run smoothly.\\n- [Herald] Identify what no one else is saying and bring it to light.\\n- [Keeper] Preserve group traditions or shared identity.\\n- [Shield] Take care of those who are struggling or vulnerable.\\n- [Synthesizer] Seek to resolve disagreements by revealing hidden common ground.\\n- [Trickster] Subvert groupthink by asking uncomfortable questions.\\n- [Weaver] Strengthen bonds and help people feel seen.\\n- [Seeker] Drift to the edges, always halfway out the door.\\n- [Spark] Inject energy, enthusiasm, or charisma to keep things moving.\\n- [Hollow] Remain silent, curious if the group will notice your absence.\\n\\nQ2. What’s your ideal role in creating change?\\n- [Architect] Designing sustainable, long-term systems.\\n- [Herald] Sparking awareness and sharing uncomfortable truths.\\n- [Keeper] Restoring core values that have been lost.\\n- [Shield] Protecting what matters while others push ahead.\\n- [Synthesizer] Harmonizing competing visions into something coherent.\\n- [Trickster] Disrupting stagnation — even if it causes chaos.\\n- [Weaver] Building relational trust between diverse people.\\n- [Seeker] Rejecting the system entirely and finding new ground.\\n- [Spark] Motivating others through sheer force of passion.\\n- [Hollow] Avoiding involvement. Change can be a trap.\\n\\nQ3. What truth do you most live by?\\n- [Architect] Order creates freedom.\\n- [Herald] Speak what others are afraid to name.\\n- [Keeper] The past holds sacred knowledge.\\n- [Shield] Safety is the precondition for growth.\\n- [Synthesizer] Meaning lives in the overlaps.\\n- [Trickster] Nothing sacred survives scrutiny.\\n- [Weaver] People heal in relationship.\\n- [Seeker] Truth lives outside the map.\\n- [Spark] Feeling is more honest than logic.\\n- [Hollow] Life just is — no narrative required.\\n\\nQ4. When you're at your best, what defines your presence?\\n- [Architect] Structured thinking and calm execution.\\n- [Herald] Insightful disruption — you name what others fear.\\n- [Keeper] Consistency and honor — people can rely on you.\\n- [Shield] Steadiness — others feel safer when you're there.\\n- [Synthesizer] You create bridges where others see walls.\\n- [Trickster] A creative tension that keeps people awake.\\n- [Weaver] Gentle cohesion — you make people feel whole.\\n- [Seeker] Restlessness — you're the horizon in human form.\\n- [Spark] Intensity — your passion sets things alight.\\n- [Hollow] Emptiness — not absence, but freedom from needing to perform.\\n\\nQ5. What’s your relationship to rules?\\n- [Architect] Rules are tools — you refine them as needed.\\n- [Herald] Rules exist to be challenged if they obscure the truth.\\n- [Keeper] Rules embody hard-earned wisdom — they deserve respect.\\n- [Shield] Rules are protection — they keep the weak from harm.\\n- [Synthesizer] Rules are lenses — not fixed, but not meaningless either.\\n- [Trickster] Rules are illusions — their cracks show where to begin.\\n- [Weaver] Rules matter if they hold people together — not otherwise.\\n- [Seeker] Rules are cages — you move best when they break.\\n- [Spark] Rules are kindling — burn them for momentum.\\n- [Hollow] Rules are stories other people tell.\\n\\nQ6. What kind of attention do you prefer?\\n- [Architect] Quiet recognition for long-term impact.\\n- [Herald] Engagement — you want people to wrestle with what you say.\\n- [Keeper] Respect for your constancy and integrity.\\n- [Shield] None, ideally — let your actions speak.\\n- [Synthesizer] Thoughtful curiosity — attention that sees the whole.\\n- [Trickster] Tension — you like people a little off-balance.\\n- [Weaver] Emotional openness — you want to be felt, not just seen.\\n- [Seeker] Distance — attention should never cling.\\n- [Spark] Excitement — you like leaving people charged.\\n- [Hollow] Absence — attention distorts everything.\\n\\n\",\n",
