DETAILED ARCHETYPE DESCRIPTIONS

[Synthesizer]
You are a pattern weaver — someone who sees meaning in contradiction, tension, and overlap. You’re drawn to complexity, not to solve it, but to understand how things relate beneath the surface. Your mind builds bridges between seemingly opposing ideas. You are a mediator of ideologies, a cartographer of ambiguity. When flourishing, you unify chaos into new clarity. But in shadow, you may struggle to act, frozen by the knowledge that every action distorts a bigger picture.

[Architect]
You move through the world by building things that last. You design systems, refine structures, and solve problems through logic and planning. You have little patience for noise or waste — your gift is turning raw material into order. When aligned, you offer immense value through discipline, integrity, and precision. But your shadow may cut you off from the human side of your work, leaving you cold, rigid, or blind to nuance.

[Trickster]
You are the disruption in the system — the one who asks, “What if none of this is real?” Tricksters reveal truth by breaking expectation. You challenge, provoke, destabilize, and invert. But not for spectacle — your chaos has purpose: to expose what is hidden or false. In strength, you bring liberation and clarity. In shadow, you can become corrosive, burning down meaning for the thrill of watching it fall.

[Weaver]
You are the connection that holds the world together. You listen deeply, speak gently, and act as the emotional thread in every space you enter. You feel before you analyze. People come to you to be seen, not fixed. When thriving, you create environments of profound healing and trust. But in shadow, you may dissolve into others, losing your own boundaries in the name of harmony.

[Keeper]
You are the steward of memory, tradition, and continuity. You understand that not all change is progress, and that some truths are carried, not discovered. You honor history — personal, cultural, spiritual — and use it to anchor those around you. In strength, you are stabilizing, wise, and quietly brave. In shadow, you can become inflexible, clinging to outdated forms out of fear of what might be lost.

[Herald]
You are a signal-bearer — someone who moves ideas through space and time. You write, speak, post, publish, and disrupt through information. You don’t just deliver news; you shape the way people *see*. In your strength, you awaken others to truth, stir action, and reframe the collective lens. But in shadow, you may speak before you understand, provoke without purpose, or chase attention more than meaning.

[Shield]
You are the wall — the one who protects, guards, and shelters. You don’t lead by flash or charm, but by consistency, presence, and defense. You notice danger early. You set boundaries without apology. When aligned, you are the reason people feel safe enough to grow. In shadow, you may harden, isolate, or control — mistaking protection for domination.

[Seeker]
You are in motion — not to escape, but to discover. You’re driven by a hunger for something deeper: authenticity, spirituality, new terrain of the soul. You resist domestication. You may feel like a visitor in every place — not quite home, not quite lost. In strength, you bring renewal and vision. In shadow, you can vanish into endless quests, abandoning what could have been beautiful.

[Spark]
You are ignition — a source of momentum, intensity, and raw emotional voltage. You move people not through ideas, but through presence. You burn bright, and when centered, you wake others up to possibility. You are often a catalyst, a leader, a firestarter. But in shadow, your flame may consume more than it illuminates. You risk becoming addicted to attention or crushed by your own performance.

[Hollow]
You are absence — maybe broken, maybe unplugged. You've stepped out of the narrative. Possibly for survival or clarity, or maybe you're simply uninterested in this story. Only you know the truth. In strength, you have clarity, detachment, and immunity to manipulation. In shadow, you risk nihilism, withdrawal, or vanishing entirely from your own story.
