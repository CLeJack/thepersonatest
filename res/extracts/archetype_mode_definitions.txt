MODE DESCRIPTIONS

[Flourishing]
You are aligned — your strategy fits your current reality. There’s flow, clarity, and responsiveness. You’re not without challenge, but you move through life with coherence.

[Transforming]
You are changing — letting go of old structures, experimenting with new ones. It may feel uncertain or chaotic, but it’s also fertile and alive.

[Overextended]
You are locked into one strategy too tightly, trying to solve every problem the same way. You may feel exhausted, pressured, or stuck in loops.

[Fragmented]
You’re switching between multiple strategies without stability. You may feel incoherent, performative, or unsure of who you are in different spaces.

[Camouflaged]
You’re acting like a different archetype because you feel you must. There’s a mismatch between your core self and your context. Others may not know the real you.

[Suppressed]
Your strategy is offline — pushed down, denied, or numbed. This often emerges after trauma, burnout, or extended disempowerment. Reconnection will take time.
